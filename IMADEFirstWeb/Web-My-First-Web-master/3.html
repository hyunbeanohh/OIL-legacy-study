  <p>This Ecma Standard defines the ECMAScript 2019 Language.
    It is the tenth edition of the ECMAScript Language Specification.
    Since publication of the first edition in 1997, ECMAScript has grown to be one of the world's most widely used general-purpose programming languages.
    It is best known as the language embedded in web browsers but has also been widely adopted for server and embedded applications.

    ECMAScript is based on several originating technologies, the most well-known being JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft).
    The language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first appeared in that company's Navigator 2.0 browser.
    It has appeared in all subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft starting with Internet Explorer 3.0.

    The development of the ECMAScript Language Specification started in November 1996.
    The first edition of this Ecma Standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 1997.
